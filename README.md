# Repliaction using Raft Consensus Algorithm

# Objective
To implement data replication in a cluster using raft distributed consensus algorithm along with graphical visualization of cluster node states.

# How to
1. Start the RabbitMQ service
2. Start RedisDB
3. Build server code using below maven command<br />
   mvn clean install
4. Execute the generated jar file using below command:<br />
   java -jar raft-consensus-{version}.jar -ip {host} -p {port} <br />
   eg. java -jar raft-consensus-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -ip localhost -p 8080 <br />
   You can execute as many servers as you wish they will add themselves to the cluster.
5. Use Pyhton file "ClientTest.py" to perform operation as a client
6. You can run the "index.htm" to get the live status of the nodes
